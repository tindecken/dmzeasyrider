&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huế is where dining is not just a daily need but a form of art, and Huế people love eating in style. Why not going on a food tour to discover its specialties beside going sightseeing once you are in the former capital of Việt Nam? 
</p>
	Different from gastronomy of other regions in Vietnam, the one of Hue is elegant, light and noble, never confused.</p>
	In the Hue gastronomy, spices are an essential part of the dishes. Especially chili, the chili not only brings to the dishes a good color but also plays the essential role in any dish of Hue; it is as a driver in a hundred of spice orchestra. The people of other regions, once coming, tasting the dishes of Hue, the breakfast, the lunch or the dinner... all are embarrassed by the strongly pricking taste of these dishes.</p>
<p>
	Formal meals for special occasions or for welcoming guests are more elaborate, usually comprising five or more dishes. A typical &lsquo;menu&rsquo; might include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			Fermented pork rolls (washed down with rice wine)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			&lsquo;Banh la&rsquo; (sweet sticky rice wrapped in leaves),</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			&lsquo;Cha tom&rsquo; (a sort of shrimp pancake)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Boiled pork with a sour prawn sauce or fermented fish, vegetables, slices of star fruit and bitter bananas</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Dried cuttlefish mixed with &lsquo;thanh tra&rsquo; fruit</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Fish steamed with mushrooms</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Fatty meat></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Soy sauce and &lsquo;envelopes&rsquo; of mandarin fruit</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Rice cooked with pineapple leaves</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Dessert would normally be a bowl of sweet lotus seed soup or local fruit.

	<h4>Vegetarian food</h4>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hue is a major Buddhist centre so its vegetarian food is well-known. Unlike vegetarian food in Western countries, Hue chefs aim to replicate the taste of dishes such as roast pork cooked with fish sauce, chicken salad, beefsteak, grilled meat roll, pork bolognese, chicken and so on. It&rsquo;s a fascinating concept, but far away from the attitudes of foreign vegetarians who are mostly motivated by health or ethical concerns.
