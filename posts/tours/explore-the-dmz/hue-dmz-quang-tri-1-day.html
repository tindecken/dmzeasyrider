    Quang Tri is famous for its DMZ tours, because it preserves many remains from the anti-American resistance war, such as the ancient citadel of Quang Tri, Khe Sanh Combat Base, Truong Son National Cemetery, Vinh Moc Tunnels, Hien Luong Bridge and Ben Hai River. Even though the war finished&nbsp; more than 20 years ago, this DMZ tour will still bring you back to one of the hardest times in Vietnam&rsquo;s recent history.
